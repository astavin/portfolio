            My name is <strong>Ala Iurco</strong>. 
            </q>
            I was born and grew up in <u>Moldova</u>, a small Eastern European country between Romania and Ukraine. <br> About 10 years ago, at age of 35 years old, I moved to the United States to start a new chapter in my life. So far, my journey <br> has been full of growth and determination. After mooving to the United States first, I focused on learning English. Next, <br> building my education, and creating a stable career while supporting my family. Each step has helped shape who I am today <br> and motivates me to keep moving forward.
